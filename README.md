# text-script
An app that runs in the background and replaces text shortcuts with pre-saved blocks of text.

## Planned future updates
- Save whatever the latest clipboard item is and replace it after shortcut is used. Currently the last textblock used fills the last clipboard spot
- Create #reload command which reloads the shortcut list with all the latest updates.
