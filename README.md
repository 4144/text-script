# text-script
An app that allows users to save shortcuts and textblocks. Typing a shortcut automatically replaces said shortcut with the content of the saved textblock. This app runs in the background and improves typing efficiency.

## Motivation
I came up with this idea when I discovered there was a lack of quality open source applications to fulfill this function. As a tech support agent, I find myself repeatedly copying the same blocks of text, such as signatures, instructions, and templates, and pasting them into emails. This is a common task in any tech support role, so I wanted to write an app to help my colleagues, and anybody else working in a similar role.
