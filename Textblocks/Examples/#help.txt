How to make a shortcut:

1. Navigate to the program folder, and go to the Textblocks folder
2. Either navigate to an existing folder in Textblocks, or create a new one
3. Create a new text file here. The naming convention is #____.txt where ____ is the shortcut you will type
4. Open the text file and put your text block / signature / template in here
5. Click "Save As" and select the same text file, but change encoding to unicode

Note: Other formats may still work, but this is designed to read unicode text files.

To exit Text-Script, type: #exit
